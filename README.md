The amount of CO2 emission from the transport sector (including cars) accounts for about 20% of total CO2 emissions. 
Accordingly, from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, reducing that proportion is a key issue. In regard to CO2 emissions from cars, 
fuel economy standards are getting tougher all over the world, so improving the fuel economy of cars is strongly desired. From now onwards, 
it is considered that the fuel economy of engines will be further improved by boosting engine efficiency and by hybridization (electrification) of cars. 
What’s more, improving fuel economy by improving “driving operation” (i.e. the operation in which a car is driven) and by smoothing traffic flows will 
come into the picture in the near future. Under these circumstances, with concern for the environment from the viewpoint of reducing CO2 and other 
exhaust emissions, the Hitachi Group is comprehensively promoting a broad range of technical developments for reducing CO2 emissions from cars.
